# C64 SEQ file reading example
This little program demonstrates how to read a SEQ file using assembler.

To compile it you either need Turbo Assembler running on a C64 or tass64 running in a cross-development environment.

The included run.sh script compiles the program, creates a disk image with the program and a sample SEQ file and runs it with VICE. It needs VICE for both the disk image creation and the emulation.
